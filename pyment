build a web app payment flow using stripe with carbon credit calculation.

requirements:

integrate stripe card payments using payment intents

frontend uses stripe.js and does not store card details

backend creates payment intent and returns client_secret

handle stripe webhook for payment_intent.succeeded

on successful payment, calculate carbon credits

carbon logic:

1 usd = 10 co2 units

example: $25 payment = 250 co2 units

after payment success:

calculate carbon credits on backend

store payment amount and carbon units in database

update user carbon ledger

show user a report:

amount paid

total carbon co2 units earned

focus on:

secure stripe integration

clean backend logic

webhook based confirmation

simple user report display
